The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on many facets of our lives, and
continue to affect travel, work and how people socially interact. This
report includes some graphs and figures on the evolution of the
breakout. Specifically, it provides comparisons on how continents
differ.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section*{Data}\label{data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Data}

The data used was sourced from `Our World In Data.' The dataset is very
broad and many more figures and statistics could have been created than
what is presented here. This report focuses on the total cases and
deaths recorded for each continent so that we can compare the
progression of the pandemic in different regions. The region of
Antarctica is excluded from the analysis due to lack of data.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section*{Results}\label{results}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Results}

Let's consider the cumulative Covid-19 cases for each continent:

\hfill

\includegraphics{Figures/Figure1.png} \hfill

While the continents cannot be distinguished clearly, the rate of
infection is visualised and we can see when continents were able to
``flatten the curve'', or more prominently, when they were not able to
do so. Notably, the rate of infection is rather high during the second
half of the pandemic, likely due to the spread of the more infectious,
but less deadly, Omicron variant.

\hfill

\includegraphics{Figures/Figure2.png} \hfill

The above figure shows only the newly recorded Covid-19 cases (i.e.~we
do no longer see the rate of infections but rather the number of
infections). Asia and Europe record more cases of Covid-19, which could
be due to dense populations or a higher frequency of testing, or likely
a combination of both. The suspicion that other regions had fewer cases
is squashed when we look at the number of deaths in the figure below.

\hfill

\includegraphics{Figures/Figure3.png} \hfill

It becomes clear that more people passed from Covid-19 than were tested
for Covid-19, in all the continents except for Oceania (that had
implemented extreme lockdown and testing measures). Lack of testing
could be due to having a limited number of tests available and/or a
limited capacity of laboratories to process tests, particularly in
Africa and South America, where deaths are significantly higher than
reported cases.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

Oceania implemented extremely strict prevention measures, which were
successful in curbing the spread of Covid-19, as well as preventing
Covid-19 deaths. With the exception of Oceania, every continent had
significant numbers of deaths due to Covid-19, and no continent seemed
to stand out in severity among the rest. The analysis did however make
it clear that there was a lack of testing, since the death toll far
outweighed the number of reported cases, for all continents except
Oceania.
